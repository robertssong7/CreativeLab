**Interactive Web Experiments:**
  A collection of lightweight, single-page applications built with React and Tailwind CSS.
  This repository focuses on logic-heavy frontend development, state management, and clean UI/UX without the overhead of complex build steps.

**Technical Highlights:**
  
  **Poker Trainer:** Implements complex game theory logic, including a 13x13 dynamic grid for hand range visualization and custom probability algorithms for street advice.
  
  **Bar Wizard:** Features a persistent "Pantry" state and a hybrid discovery engine that fetches data from an external API while filtering against local inventory.


Because these are self-contained single-file applications, no npm install is required.
  Clone the repository:
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tinkerprojects.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tinkerprojects.git)
    Navigate to the project folder (e.g., /poker).
    Open index.html in any modern web browser.
